# PHP OOP

## Requirements

- Basic Knowledge of PHP with any language (I know JS OOP)

---

## Overriding

- Overriding is redefining a class member on the child class
- You can change the visability of the class member from private (in super) to public (in sub) but not the opposite
- Constants can be overriden
- To prevent overriding, use `final` keyword in the super class before the visibility marker
- You can use `final` keyword with the classes to prevent extension (inheritence)
